### Details
This project has been scaffolded using `create-react-app`. 

For the GraphQL service `apollo-grapql` has been imported. 

For styling and layout `styled-components` has been used. This allows the use of CSS in javascript files. For some added transitions and effects `framer-motion` to smoothen the UI was used. 

Future work. Add greater test coverage: unit, integration, end-to-end. Make design and layout responsive for different device sizes.
